# Neuron_tutorials

This repository contains a couple of Jupyter notebooks that can be used to understand electrical properties of neurons.
Passive_membrane_tutorial models the passive membrane of a neuron and lets users explore how membrane potential changes depending on the concentrations of ions outside versus inside the cell. Additionally, it models how a passive membrane reacts to a current injection.

The Hodgkin-Huxley_tutorial file lets users model a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron and how it reacts in response to current injections. The comments also have certain questions and guidelines for users to explore.
